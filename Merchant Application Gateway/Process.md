# **Overview**

Our Application Gateway is designed to accommodate various input requirements, allowing development of a single interface configured to handle many different scenarios.

The Application Gateway uses web services to present distributed methods for integration into client applications, and an interface can be developed with any programming language that can consume a web service.

We use (XML)Extensible Markup Language, to send data packet requests and receive responses from the Authorization Gateway.  Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is used for XML message exchange over HTTPS, we also employ a custom SOAP header for authentication information. 


# **Connection Method**
Paya Services supports connection via secure (https) webservice using SOAP.  SOAP is a simple XML-based protocol to let applications exchange information over HTTP.  
The webservice address used for certification and testing is as follows:

https://demo.eftchecks.com/webservices/AppGateway.asmx

A username and password for certification will be provided upon request.

_NOTE:  A live webservice address, username, and password will be supplied upon successful certification._

# **Supported Electronic Applications**
 - Telephone Initiated Entry (TEL)
 - Internet Initiated Entry (WEB)
 - Prearranged Payment and Deposit Entry (PPD)
 - Corporate Credit or Debit (CCD)
 - Point-of-Purchase Entry (POP)
 - Check 21 (C21) 
 - Gift Card

# **Submission**
The Application Gateway has been designed for fast and easy integration with your existing system.  Simply create an xml data packet that conforms to the NewMerchApp xsd and pass it to the Application Gateway for processing. To accomplish this the Application Gateway provides 2 web methods: one for certification and one for production.  In addition, each web method contains a custom SOAP header used for authentication.

## **SOAP Header**

|                 |               |                                                                |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|     UserName    |     String    |     Username   provided by Paya Services for authorization.    |
|     Password    |     String    |     Password   provided by Paya Services for authorization.    |

(Please Holder Example) 

***Note about Special Characters**
Because the Data packet is XML, some special characters must be escaped to be included in the data. Please see the examples below.

|     Special Character    |     Symbol    |     Escaped Form     |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
