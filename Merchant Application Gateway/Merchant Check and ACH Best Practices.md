# Check and ACH Processing Best Practices

## Check and ACH Processing Overview

Paya is a leading integrated payment processing provider for electronic check payment processing and gift card services. 

Electronic payment processing is more than checks. Paya is dedicated to facilitating payments of sales tickets from your customers and fund your business through processing ACH and/or Checks to your customers’ U.S.-based financial institution. 

Note: Automated Clearing House (ACH) are governed by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA), the organization that manages the electronic movement of money in the U.S. Paya has unique rules to follow based on the NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines and has compliance specialists and risk analysts on staff to help guide and assist you in knowing and following the applicable rules. 

Below, we have summarized some basics to help you with some best practices and tips to make your relationship with Paya successful and to protect yourself from customer payment fraud. 

## Payment Solutions

Paya’s offerings include converting a check to ACH (Point of Purchase) or to Check 21 (Remote Deposit Capture), along with other payment environments using a customer’s bank account. 

Listed below are the programs developed by Paya for electronic payment processing, based on environments that businesses receive payments. 

|     Program                                              |     Customer Payment Method             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|     Point-of-Sale   Conversion, Paper Check, Check 21    |     Face-to-Face   Physical Check       |
|     Check   21                                           |     Mailed   Physical Check             |
|     ACH   Debit/Credit                                   |     Signed   Agreement/Form             |
|     Checks   by Phone                                    |     Payment   info over the phone       |
|     Checks   by Web                                      |     Payment   info over the Internet    |

Each program has different rules and requirements that are strictly enforced.

Paya also offers a funding “guarantee” (like insurance) for qualified businesses. Check funding increases security and offers peace of mind. More details are available in the “Guarantee” section below.

## Guarantee
Improve cash flow and eliminate collection operations with Guarantee. Below are the programs eligible for Guarantee:
 - POS Conversion
 - ACH Debit (Single Debit Transactions Only)
 - Paper Check – Paper Guarantee
 - Checks by Phone

## How does Guarantee work?
While completing a check transaction, the equipment electronically and automatically receives a verification of the checkwriter’s account history in order to approve and process the debit. Requirements for Guarantee vary by program and can help you avoid risk of non-payment from customers’ returned checks. The Guarantee programs are designed for businesses to keep funds from the payment while Paya handles the collection of the return from the customer. The funds are guaranteed as long as authorization stipulations are met. 
Customer claims of fraud, stop payments, and customer fraud are essentially eliminated from funding guarantee and your company will be debited for the return. 

## Paper Check
Non-conversion Guarantee/Non-Guarantee
The verification program allows Paya to “verify” that the customer doesn’t have any outstanding returned checks. Once the check is approved, you can proceed with submitting the check.
 - Equipment will give an approval “auth” code or “decline” reason. Document the auth code number on the check and deposit it into your bank account. 
 - Physical checks must be deposited into your bank on the next banking day.
 - If you receive a “decline” response from the equipment for any reason, do not attempt to process that check again.
 - If you do not already have a Bank Authorization Form on file with your bank, complete the form and file it at your bank.
   - If any checks are deposited and returned as unpaid by the customer, your bank can mail the checks directly to Paya to begin your Guarantee check claim (only applicable for the Guarantee program).
 - If the customer’s payment returns, please reference the Guarantee section. 

# Point-of-Sale Conversion

## Guarantee/Non-Guarantee

The ACH Conversion program allows Paya to verify that a customer doesn’t have any outstanding returned checks. If the check is approved, Paya processes the check as an ACH transaction and sends you the funds for the check. 

## How it works:
 - Equipment will give an approval “auth” code or “decline” reason and print a receipt. 
 - If you receive a “decline” response from the equipment for any reason, do not attempt to process that check again. 
 - If you receive an “approval”, the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) receipt will print. 
 - The EFT must be filled out completely and legibly with the customer’s:
   - Full printed name
   - Phone number with an area code
   - Signature
 - The EFT receipt should be securely stored and retained for two (2) years from the ACH transaction to the customer’s bank account. 
 - The EFT receipt must be produced within forty-eight (48) hours upon request.
 - If you receive a NO-ACH response, the equipment will give an approval “auth” code. Document the auth code number on the check and deposit it into your bank account. 
   - In the event of a NO-ACH response, the physical check must be deposited into your bank on the next banking day.
   - In the event of a NO-ACH response and you do not already have a Bank Authorization Form on file with your bank, you must complete the form and take it to be filed at your bank. This ensures that any checks that are deposited and returned as unpaid by your customer, the bank can mail the checks directly to Paya to begin your Guarantee check claim (only applicable for the Guarantee program). 
 - If your customer’s payment returns, please reference the Guarantee section. 

# Check 21

## Face-to-Face, Guarantee/Non-Guarantee

The Check 21 program “verifies” that a Paya customer does not have any outstanding returned checks. Once the check is approved, Paya processes the check image, both front and back, and sends you the funds. 
 - Equipment will give an approval “auth” code or “decline” reason. You will need to write the auth code number on the check before storing.
 - Do not deposit the check unless Paya contacts you and requests that you deposit.
 - The physical check must be stored by you for a minimum of 90-days and then can be shredded.  
 - If your customer’s payment returns, please see the Guarantee section above. 

Consumer Not Present – Guarantee/Non-Guarantee
The Check 21 program “verifies” that a Paya customer does not have any outstanding returned checks. Once the check is approved, Paya processes the check image, both front and back, and sends you the funds. Checks received in the mail may be accepted up to two weeks after the date of the check.
See below for more tips:
 - Equipment will give an approval “auth” code or “decline” reason. You will need to write the auth code number on the check before storing.
 - Do not deposit the check unless Paya contacts you and requests that you deposit.
 - The physical check must be stored by you for a minimum of 90-days and then can be shredded.  
 - If your customer’s payment returns, please see the Guarantee section above.

# Check Verification Services

Paya provides three different levels of consumer bank account verification or identity validation through third-party vendors. Paya’s verification features assist in reducing overall Paya and/or client loss by declining to process check and ACH transactions to bank accounts that may be more likely to return. 

## Level One: Nationwide Proprietary Database
 - Thousands of organizations nationwide participate in contributing data to a third-party vendor database that tracks consumers by checking account number and driver’s license number. The database uses the check and ACH transaction information to verify if a consumer has outstanding bad checks within the participating clients and/or check collection companies. 
 - A consumer with prior returned check(s) or ACH transactions associated with their bank account or driver’s license will be declined from processing. 
 - This database verification enables Paya to customize velocity limits for consumer transactions. Each velocity limit only approves a specific number of checks with a total combined amount per consumer with a specific window. 

## Level Two: Advanced Account Validation
 - Paya uses a third-party vendor to complete real-time verification of a checking or savings account for the account status. The Advanced Banking Verification checks if a consumer’s bank account is open and has a minimum of $1.00 balance. 

## How does the verification work?
 - Consumers’ financial institution report to the third-party vendor on the status of their customers’ bank accounts at the end of the prior day’s processing cycle. 
 - When Paya receives a transaction for verification, the data is passed to the vendor seamlessly in real-time.
 - The vendor will check the status from the financial institution and respond as “approve” or “decline” based on the status. 

## What causes a decline?
 - Accounts that do not match an active bank account
 - Accounts that have recent negative history of insufficient funds that have returned
 - Accounts that match a closed or negative bank account

## Items to Note:
 - An approved transaction can still return because changes can happen to a bank account between the verification and presentation.
 - Not all banks participate, approximately 75% to 80% take part in this verification process
 - If the bank account numb er is for a non-participating bank, the transaction will be approved, but the transaction can still be returned

## Level Three: Identity Verification
 - Paya uses a third-party vendor to complete real-time seamless authentication of consumer’s identity using the following consumer information that is collected and entered into a check or ACH transaction:
   - Name
   - Address
   - Date of Birth
   - Social Security Number

## Money Laundering
  
You can only deposit transactions for your own business. Depositing transactions for a business that does not have a valid processing agreement is called laundering or factoring. Laundering is a form of fraud associated with high chargeback rates and the potential for forcing clients out of business. General information on Money Laundering can be found here.

## Fraudulent or Suspicious Transactions
  
We ask our clients to always be on the lookout for possible fraud. Below are some tips that may help spot a bad check writer:
 - Valid checks should always have the following:
   - Perforated edge as checks are made in sheets or books separated by perforations. 
   - Check number should always be at the top right-hand side of the check.
   - Check numbers should be sequential and should change from check-to-check.
   - Checks with numbers less than 200 should be refused or taken with caution.
   - Customer’s name and address should be pre-printed, and the fonts should be identical.
   - Look for erasures or alterations on checks.
   - There should not be any staining or discoloration on the face of the check.
   - On the bottom of the check, it should contain the MICR encoding.

 

 - Inspect that the check is signed by the person who is listed as the account holder. 
 - If the appearance of the check being presented or the behavior of the person presenting the check is suspicious, consider not accepting a check for payment. 
 - The ID the customer presents should correspond to the person in front of you. If the date of birth does not seem appropriate or the picture does not appear to be of the same person making the purchase, the check should be refused immediately before a transaction is attempted. 
If you have any questions about the legitimacy of your customer or the check presented to you, we urge you to carefully consider not taking the check as form of payment. Remember, clients can help us to continue to keep our product costs low by always being on the lookout for possible fraud. 
If you are ever unsure of how to handle a check or unusual transaction, please consult with a knowledgeable Paya Support Agent. Please also refer to your terminal guide, where you will find many helpful “Quick-tips”.

### Information Available in My Online Reports
My Online Reports allows you to view your deposits, transaction data, batch details, monthly statements, chargebacks, and more. There are a variety of reporting features that allow you to scope down into as much detail as you need. Reports can be viewed on the website or exported to Excel, Word, HTML, or XML and you can customize your reports to fit your needs. 

Below is an overview of the data in some of the reports and how they work together:
 - Batch Results - Used on a client or per location basis as an overall and up-to-date view of a given batch or a days’ worth or processing.
 - Bank Statement – Used on a client or per location basis in conjunction with a physical bank statement to reconcile the daily credits, fees, and debits for the amount that was sent to the business bank account per a specific date range.
 - Deposit Details – Used on a client or per location basis in conjunction with the Bank Statement to show the individual transactions that make up the daily deposits and debits; this does not include fees. 
 - Transactions – Used on a client or per location basis to view the list of individual consumer debit transactions within a specified date range. This report is updated as changes happen within a consumer debit transaction.
 - Transactions Received – Used on a client or per location basis to view a list of individual transaction(s) based on the date that the transaction(s) are received at Paya. 
 - Returns – Used on a client or per location basis to view a list of individual returned transaction(s) based on the date that the return(s) are received at Paya.
 - Uncollected Checks – Used on a client or per location basis to view the individual returned transaction(s) combined to make a client debit. This is categorized based on date range on the end of cycle (EOC) date when return(s) are received at Paya. The amount correlates to the Client Bank Statement.

# Customer Transaction Disputes
  
Businesses that have used credit card processing are familiar with the term “chargeback”. A chargeback is when a customer disputes a credit card payment. Federal banking laws and NACHA Operating Rules & Guidelines allow customer disputes to protect consumers. 
Paya Services uses similar terminology. However, in Paya Services, a client receives a “chargeback” after a customer’s return is received from an ACH debit or Check 21 transaction when the client previously received funding from Paya Services and one of the following occurred: 

 - Client does not have a funding Guarantee service
 - Paya Services has removed the funding Guarantee

Federal banking laws and NACHA have specific guidelines and rules for all parts of transaction processing, including returning transactions or check that may or may not originate from a customer’s dispute. Not all returns are from disputes and a list of the return codes is available in your online reporting. 
 - Decisions to return a transaction are made by the customer or account holder’s bank.
 - Decisions to accept a return are made by the bank that processed the transaction. 

The customer’s bank can only send a return for a specific reason and for specific time-frames. When returning a transaction, the customer’s bank will place funds back in the bank account, similar to a refund. Then the customer’s bank sends a return through the Federal Reserve or ACH Network to the bank that processed the transaction. The customer’s bank assigns a return code to indicate the reason for the return. 
A customer can dispute a transaction through their bank when he or she believes that they did not authorize for a business to send the debit. Paya Services and the client are not always afforded the right to disprove a customer or account holder’s dispute. Customer disputes are allowed at any time. 
Before the 61st calendar day from the settlement date of a transaction, the customer’s bank is allowed to return a transaction based only on the customer’s claim when the following is met: 
 
 - Account holder signs a WSUD
 - Customer’s bank has requested the proof of authorization prior from then processing bank
   - Required wait time is 10-calendar days for a reply
 - The processing bank requests that Paya must provide proof of authorization within enough time for the processing bank to supply the information to the customer’s bank
 - Paya requests the proof of authorization from the originating client:
   - If the proof of authorization is not provided, then the customer’s bank is allowed to return the ACH transaction(s)
   - If the proof of authorization was provided and the customer’s bank believes that the ACH transaction(s) was fraudulently authorized by someone not on the account, then the customer’s bank will be allowed to return the debit(s)
   - If the proof of authorization was provided and the customer’s bank believes that the authorization was not obtained in compliance with the NACHA rules in mind, then the customer’s bank will be allowed to return the debit(s)

# Expedited Processor Returns
  
## E-Code Returns
  
The Expedited Processor Returns were created and implemented as a requirement of Paya’s processing bank to comply with the NACHA Operating Rules. 
Clients are not allowed to process transactions to bank accounts in which they have received a previous return code other than insufficient funds and/or uncollected funds. To do so, this could be a NACHA Rules Violation. 
A transaction that was previously returned can only be re-attempted or re-sent if:

 - Transaction(s) returned for insufficient (R01) or uncollected funds (R09)
 - Transaction(s) returned for stop payment and re-initiation has been authorized by the Receiver in a new authorization
 - Corrective action to remedy the reason for the return, such as a typo

A transaction that was previously returned can only be re-attempted or re-sent within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the settlement date of the original attempt. 
A transaction that was previously returned can only be re-attempted or re-sent if it has not been returned for insufficient or uncollected funds more than two times following the first return.
Paya is required to enforce restrictions on the types of ACH transactions that may be originated. Paya strives to protect its clients from NACHA Rule Violations. Therefore, Paya developed the Expedites Processor Returns to stop a client from processing transactions that could be considered in violation to the NACHA Operating Rules. 
Paya labels the Expedited Processor Returns with an E-Code instead of an R-Code to provide clients the ability to differentiate between the standard “Receiving Bank” initiated returns (R-Code) and “Processor” initiated returns (E-Code). 
The E-Codes are designed based on the customer or account holder and what Paya expects his or her bank to do based on a transaction previously returned. This means Paya expects the bank to return more transactions using the same return code after first returning one transaction. The E-Codes are used for Check 21 transactions as well as ACH transactions, which are used for consistency along product lines. An additional benefit of E-Code Returns for clients is the acceleration of returns to be received within 1-3 business days. 

## Examples:

 - If a customer’s account was closed/invalid/not located yesterday, there is minimal likelihood that the account will be open today.
 - If a customer did not allow client ABC to debit his or her account yesterday, there is minimal likelihood that he or she will not allow client ABC to debit their account today.
 - If a customer allowed client XYZ to debit his or her account yesterday, but did not allow client ABC, this will not affect the transactions for client XYZ. 

The E-Code feature is not an overall opt-in/opt-out feature. An E-Code block can be removed from a customer’s bank account once the client that processed the transaction provides a letter from the customer’s bank (on bank letterhead) that states the bank account is active and/or the stop payment has been removed. For more details, please contact your payment provider. 

## Transaction Returns

NACHA calculates returns on a rolling sixty (60) day period and each submission counts individually. Return rates do not include reversals, credits, refunds, or Expedited (E-Code) Returns. 
NACHA displays two ways to calculate return rates while Paya calculates the return rates by dividing the number of debit transactions returned for the preceding sixty (60) days by the total number of debit transactions contained within the files in which the original transactions were processed. Return rates are used for Check 21 transactions as well as ACH transactions for consistency along product lines. 
Below are the NACHA return rates that are allowed for a 60-day period:

 - Overall Returns are less than 15%
 - Unauthorized Returns (R05/R07/R10/R29/R51) are less than 0.5%
 - Admin Returns (R02/R03/R04) are less than 3%

Example: 

Client processes 100 transactions within 60-days and 10 of these transactions returned with the following return codes: 
 - 6 at R01 and R09
 - 3 at R02, R03, and R04
 - 1 at R10

The return rates would be as follows:
 - Overall Returns as 10/10 = 10%, which is below the NACHA limit
 - Unauthorized Returns as 1/10 = 1%, which is over the NACHA limit
 - Admin Returns as 3/10 = 3%, which is at the NACHA limit

## Transaction Return Tips

Paya’s goal is to provide guidance that will assist you in maintaining return rates below the NACHA acceptable limits and help you prevent returns from debits you process for your customers. 
Some of the most common fatal return codes are noted below:

 - R02/E02 – Closed Account
 - R03/E03 – No Account/Unable to Locate
 - R04/E04 – Invalid Account Number
 - R05/E05 – Unauthorized Debit to a Consumer Account Using Corporate SEC Code
 - R07/E07 – Authorization Revoked by Customer
 - R08/E08 – Payment Stopped
 - R10/E10 – Customer Advised Originator Not Known and/or Not Authorized to Debit Account 
 - R11/E11 – Customer Advises Not in Accordance with Authorization
 - R13/E13 – EDFI Not Qualified to Participate
 - R14/E14 – Representative Payee Deceased or Unable to Continue in that Capacity
 - R16/E16 – Frozen Account
 - R20/E20 – Non-Transaction Account
 - R29/E29 – Corp Customer Advises Not Authorized

When you receive a return other than R01 or R09, you or your customer are required to act before you can process a new debit to the same bank account. Continuing to attempt debits to the same bank account that has a return code other than R01 or R09 will most likely result in more returns and may result in a NACA Rule Violation, which we want to help you avoid. Make a point to remove recurring customers from the next billing cycle when you receive a return with any return code other than R01 or R09. 
Returns from your customer with a return code of R05/R10/R29 may indicate that the customer is required to notify their bank to provide authorization with the bank in order to accept a debit from you. The customer’s bank will need our Company ID number, which is within the details that we send with a transaction. You can receive our Company ID number by contacting us directly. You can provide this number to your customer(s) and request the customer notify his or her bank to allow for ACH payments to process without being returned.
